## About the project

The project was made by me during my winter internship at OnisTech Info Systems, Kanpur.

The project is a full stack application to facilitate Multi Level Networking companies in keeping the record of their team structure.
The fetures present in the Repo are :
 ->) Adding new members under an existing member.
 ->) Presenting the structure in a Tree format.

 In this project I designed the entire database, and worked on the above stated feature.
 (There were many more features to the project which I did not have access to)

 ## Tech Stack

The front end of the project was built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript and AdminLTE Dashboard.
The Back end was made using PHP & MYSQL Database.

The entire project was built on CodeInginter using MVC Framework.
